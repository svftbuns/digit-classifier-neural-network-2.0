# Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network-v2.0 (CNN)

This is a continuation of my previous repository, digit-classifier-neural-network-v1.0, in which I built a Dense Neural Network from scratch. In this alternative version, I wanted to experiment with other types of neural network and thus decided to build a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch (using mainly numpy).

## CNN model layers
